# 1.4. Install the CDT

Install the __C__ontract __D__evelopment __T__oolkit

------------------------------------------------------

The EOSIO Contract Development Toolkit, CDT for short, is a collection of __tools__ related to `contract compilation`. Subsequent tutorials use the CDT primarily for:

- __compiling__ `contracts` and
- __generating__ `ABIs`

Starting from 1.3.x, CDT supports Mac OS X brew, Linux Debian and RPM packages. The easiest option to install would be using one of these package systems. Pick one installation method only.

> If you have versions of eosio.cdt prior to 1.3.0 installed on your system, please uninstall before proceeding
